## Economy  
### Coursera Introduction to Economic Theories  
four theories  
three economic domains: market, state, communities (ngo, labor organisations, social groups)  
actors: firms, state agnecies, community actors

**ECONOMICS AS A SCIENCE:**
all about needs and ends due to scarcity:  
means not fixed, in dessert water more valuable than diamonds  
ends not fixed, consumers develop new desires over their lifetime  
scarcity manipulated by those with power, e.g. crop patents, so poor farmers have to be buy them to grow them  
social science: with three actors and domains  
each hast their own values  
economy has:  
efficiency, criterion to measure market outcome  
broad: minimise input, maximise output  
broad: minimisation of waste throughout economy, society, earth  
other values in econ can be:  
fairness, freedom, trust, equality

course presents:  
**social econ:**
embededness = econ part of society  
recognition of community, mann many econ agents have different egoistic values  
economic agents are embedded in society, strong social dimension in econ, includes power and also ccohesion

**institutional econ:**
formal = regulation, codified rules  
informal = unwritten rules  
asymmetric = institutions with different effects on different groups  
economic agents at group level, not only "I", also "we" -> group level rationality  
decision-making by econ agents influenced by their norms, values, social status etc.

**post keynesian econ**
lack of effective demand:  
AD = total demand  
low AD -> pessimism -> lower consumption and investment -> lower AD  
Market power:  
monopoly, monopsony, oligopoly are standard in real world  
uncertainty  
fundamental influence on uncertainty  
markets not in equilibrium at all, uncertainty source of instability

**neoclassical econ**
abstract theory: idiealized economic context  
market equilibrium, effiency  
utility function = indifference curve  
law of diminishing marginal utility  
starts from individuals who make their own decisions based on their own interests  
weigh cost and benefits and risks only for themselves  
maximise utility independently of that form others

**rationality in the four theories:**
![Pasted Graphic.png](../_resources/8fc4ae079cd84a2292ce005d1a1e564d.png)

**Utility Maximization**
concept in microeconomics  
describes human behavior with set of preferences and a process to get the best deal  
curve with trade-offs for what contributes to agents pleasures with different prices and income levels  
the higher the budget the higher the utility

**Economics of individuals and households**
whats economic about individuals and households?  
recognises cooperation and conflict

economic functions of households:

1.  reproduction: unpaid caring for current and future generations
2.  joint production through division of labor = specilisation of members, unpaid and paid work
3.  joint consumption of goods, economies of scale: more ppl single product, economies of scope, e.g. having dinner together instead of alone
4.  Income pooling
5.  risk pooling

GENDER: socially and culutrally constructed models  
gender division, stereotypes, gender-based labor division  
men more paid, women more unpaid work  
on average women work more hours per week

categories of time-use:  
paid, unpaid work, leisure  
THIRd-PERSON CRITERION:  
everything you can hire a third person to do the work for you is work, everything else leisure, and consumption of something is leisure

EXAMPLE:  
make tee for yourself  
preparing and doing it is work until drinking, which is consumption in leisure time

household bargaining = continious interactions to achieve group and personal goals  
sources of bargaining power: resources, skills, opportunities  
**threat point** of bargaining: exit-situation for each partner: independent resources, skill, opportunities '=> credible threat

example:  
russian women 2.5x more work done by women
![Pasted Graphic 1.png](../_resources/03ab4322d6874fc693b5b795a21dd42a.png)
![Pasted Graphic 2.png](../_resources/aa54366c7476461ea1852bf2be5e51ae.png)
household income bigger  
leisure time less

social and institutional economics focus on conflict  
neoclassical on cooperation

**Social and Institutional Ecopnomics of Individiuals and Households**
well-being outcomes: big house, independent income,income security, leisure time, fairness in housework, etc.
![Pasted Graphic 3.png](../_resources/a3eb52f7854541bb8003c8b5fe129337.png)
![Pasted Graphic 4.png](../_resources/517dc803d92841e2a941cf3335fc52ff.png)
![Pasted Graphic 5.png](../_resources/2b99fb582ed041d6bb65caff25c50e6f.png)
for total well-being greater with gender equal norms  
why would vlad help to push this shift, when he himself doesn't benefit from it, which policies could help?

**Necoclassical Economics of Individiuals and Households**
do gender equal, gender stereotypes, and reverse sterotype models
neoclassical: maximise money output: short-term analysis, no institutional or social constraints, time = money  
all about solving maximisiation problems  
-\> vlads work more expensive
![Pasted Graphic 6.png](../_resources/b690c4f466304284a14d408765a1eb1b.png)
market goods are paid work, home goods unpaid work  
total value of home goods is 2500, 11hrs * 200 = 2200 of that by Olga
![Pasted Graphic 7.png](../_resources/b928fa69ef2c4ce0ab38fcdb149d5b6f.png)

from financial perspective gender stereotype creates highest well-being  
vlad bread winner, olga house maker  
-\> policy makers should support women on labor market: e.g. parental leave  
change is slow without strong commitment of governments, businesses and civil society organisations

**Consumption Theories**
consumer demand  
individual consumer demand:  
final consumer goods: restaurant meal  
intermediate consumer goods: vegetables for you meal  
durable consumer goods: forks ´, tables  
services: pizza delivery

consumption by state and communities:  
public goods  
community services

**Social Economics of Consumption**
no consumer sovereignty and many influences:  
ads, social norms, market power, living standards, consumer credirt, temptations  
types of good:  
normal good: you buy more of it when you have more money, e.g. clothes  
inferior good: you buy less of it with more money, e.g. public transit  
Giffen good (named after scottish economist Robert Giffen): people buy less of it when price decreases, e.g. buy less rice to buy more nutritious vegetables

**Institutional Theories of Consumption**
social norms  
consumerism => Veblen good, willingness to pay higher prices that have cheaper alternatives  
why would they do that?: information problem, status good -> Veblen Effect

**Post-Keynesianism**
Engel Curve:
![Pasted Graphic 8.png](../_resources/19557cb43e0a49a3b2219afa9ae1e979.png)
with increasing income consumption decreases in relation to income  
negative relation on curve between x and y  
c = propensity to consume  
s = propensity to save

C = cY consumption  
S = sY saving  
Y = C + S income  
substitute:  
Y = cY + sY  
1 = c + s  
small size letters are proportions  
example:  
income is 100  
C = 80, c = 0.8

**Necoclassical Consumption**
limited to normal goods
![Pasted Graphic 9.png](../_resources/180b0299cd2e44b2831fb112894ad2a5.png)
P, price, Q, quantity, D, demand  
consumers of D2 and D3 have either a larger budget, or a larger preferences for that specific product

**price elasticity of demand:**
percentage change in demand after price change  
low elasticity -> producer makes money, people will continue to buy  
E = ΔD/ΔP  
E is negative for normnal goods  
E is inelastic for 0 < E < 1  
E is elastic E > 1

cross elasticities of demand:  
substitution effect: new consumers because cheaper than competition, always engative  
income effect: positive or negative

utility function: people like to diversify their consumer baskets  
marginal utility = extra utility gained from adding one unit: at some point you don't derive any utility after the 10th glass of coke
![Pasted Graphic 10.png](../_resources/2f7c0289551d424b8ac2083495e24110.png)
Mua, marginal utility of good a  
Pa, price of a  
Mua/Pa = Mub/Pb = Muc/Pc
![Pasted Graphic 12.png](../_resources/80ffb66c0b0d4212b9b4dee46d1e1aa3.png)
maximised utility at point A, any point below black straight line is with budget left and you want to maximise utility hence maximise consumption
![Pasted Graphic 13.png](../_resources/5a95d4b565304b29a9edd51a341b6e0d.png)

**Household Bargaining Work in Institutional Economics**
household work hours are valued at income level of the corresponding individual -> opportunity cost

gender equal norm scenario:  
paid and unpaid work is divided equally

**Price Elasticity**
change in demand in response to change in price  
e = ΔD / ΔP

inelastic: 0<e<1  
elastic: e>=1

example: e = -20/10=-2, which is elastic  
e = 5/-10 which is between 0 and 1 therefore inelastic

**Utility Maximisation**
elegant explanation of how much consumers buy of each good  
MUa/Pa = MUb/Pb  
this just explains rationally what consumers do intuiotively

**How to derive the Individual Demand Function**
helps you see connection between consumers' preferences and the actual demand for goods on the market on the other hand

utility functions: to goods, one on each axis  
demand function: price per amount of good

example: budget = 12, pie = 4, coffee = 2

**Organization of Communities**
societal triangulation  
clashes between interest ideologies ideas

communities create social value -> social capital  
consumer organisations, and single issue movements, e.g. greenpeace => NGO  
but firms are in theory firms are also NGOs, therefore economists say NPO, or non market orgs  
organizations are as pluralistic as the bases of the economy

**What about gender?**
can they use the SDGs to improve household bargaining  
SDG as refernce framework, achieve gender equality etc.  
sustaiable development: economic, social, environment  
SDG 5: Gender Equality  
UN: gender euqality will fuel economic properity

## Russia  
### Anomalies in election data  
"Russian election data revisited" - Kobak, Shpilkin, Pshenichnikov  
Thesis: human attraction to round numbers -> fraud would show up as frequent integer percentages  
Example: polling station with 1755 registered voters, election officials choose 85%  
1755 * 0.85 = 1491.75 -> 1492 ballots have to be reported for target value of 85%  
the ratio 1492/1755 = 0.85014245 is remarkable because it's even
![Pasted Graphic 11.png](../_resources/43939a071c294fe09773bffe239f8bfe.png)
spikes at integer values in turnout and leader's result  
black arrows are peak at 64.3% turnout and 62.2% leader's result in the city of Saratov, do not count towards integer anomalies  
their product 0.643 * 0.622 = 0.399946 -> 0.4, which is the fraction of leader's votes with respect to the total number of registered voters

## US  
### Presidential Election  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k)  
"The Trouble with the Electoral College"
- In the US it is possible to win the presidential election with 22% of the popular vote
- electoral college consists of 538 electors
- absolute majority of at least 270 votes required
- electors are nominated for each state, differs significantly, primary elections, nomination by the state's governor etc
- elctors can be aything but "Office of Trust or Profit under the United States"
- each elector pledges which vote she will cast, most abide, but some become "faithless"
- slate = Kandidatenliste
- only Maine and Nebraska split electoral college votes, the others go by the winner the winner takes it all principle
- each state has at least three votes (plus D.C. also three)
- WY 200k per electoral vote, CA 700k per elctoral vote  
    -\> candidates ignore states where they are going to win by a large margin  
    -\> win votes of people who count the most: e.g. ignore California win WY
- according to CGP Grey 21.91% of perfectly splitted popular vote to get 50.19% of the electoral vote in 2011  
    *this is without regards to the fact that not an absolute majority is required*
- top ten cities make up 8% and top 100 make up 19.4% of the poulation *looking at city boudaries not metro areas*  
    -\> direct elections wouldn't result in candidates jetting between L.A., N.Y. and Chicago  
    "compromistitution"

"National Popular Vote Interstate Compact", NPVIC, NaPoVoInterCo (CGP Grey)  
agreement that state's electors vote for candidate who won the popular vote nationwide  
as of 3, 2020 adopted by 15 states and 73% of the 50% / 270 electoral college votes needed to give it legal force

## Depression  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F3vfUNDBtM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F3vfUNDBtM)  
"8 Signs Someone is Secretly Depressed"

- smiling/high-functioning/hidden depression
- clinically depressed person hides their condition, acting such that you believe their lives are perfectly happy  
    Signs:
- feel emotions on a much deeper level, because they bottle up so much, being more affectionate, angered, saddened in life and when being asked questions
- less positive and optimistic, cynical
- obesessed with being the best, depression, hidden or not can rob you of the simple pleasures in life, overworking to distract oneself from emotions
- sudden mood swings, makes enjoying things hard, emotionally unhinged
- drug abuse, 1 in 5 depressed people also have a substance abuse problem (Anxiety and Depression Association/A.D.A.A.)
- "out of it", forgetting, difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering (recent events), speak and move slugishly
- feeling bad about asking for help, subtle cries for help, often taken back immediately, don't want to burden anyone
- always trying to look and act happy, desocialize to not be seen unhappy
- extra from comments: sarcasm hand humor (-> Steppenwolf)

"Warum barfuß laufen vor Verletzungen schützen könnte"

- es gibt keine Studie, die belegt, dass federnde Schuhe vor Verletzungen schützen
- Menschen, die ihr lebenlang barfuß laufen, rollen beim Gehen auch mit der Ferse ab, aber wechseln beim schneller werden auf den Vorfuß
- beim Fersenlauf erzeugt jeder Schritt eine Stoß, der über das Sprunggelenk und Knie bis in die Hüfte wirkt
- beim Vorfußlauf wird der Aufprall von den Knochen, Sehnen und Muskeln der Füße aufgefangen -> Fuß wirkt wie eine Feder
- Belastung beim Laufen in Schuhen bis zu dreimal höher, trotz Schuhdämpfung
- Achtung! Umstieg braucht viel Zeit

## Logic gates  
XOR  
exklusives oder, addition without carry  
denoted as '^' in programming languages

## Cryptography  
**MAC**
![1__#$!@%!#__Pasted Graphic 10.png](../_resources/9694ecba22da4e1298141abb782ac935.png)
- MAC then encrypt -> decrypt then validate data; introduces a multitude of problems like padding oracles  
### Crypto Attacks  
**Stream Cipher Reuse**
- eSTREAM modern, takes nonce along with the key
- RC4 most common stream cipher
- mitigate the issue by XORing, this is not perfect

**ECB Block Reordering**
**ECB Decryption**

stream cipher reuse, ECB Block Reordering and Decryption rely on the fact that a server will decrypt data, that was tampered with  
-\> solution: encrypt data then append a MAC of the encrypted data  
**Padding and padding oracles**
- CBC-mode data padded with PKCS#7
- oracle: when server behaves differently when decrypting improperly padded data  
**Hash length extension**
### Electronic codebook - ECB
- message is divided in to blocks, and each block is encrypted seperately
![1__#$!@%!#__Pasted Graphic 5.png](../_resources/1519c144a78b4f0791443e0a4d9be984.png)
- identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks -> insecure because data patterns aren't well hidden, no diffusion
![1__#$!@%!#__Pasted Graphic 8.png](../_resources/86774020925145c588ed4fa4e8f64a6b.png)
above is an extreme example in which a bitmap image with large areas of uniform color is encrypted with ECB
- like all block ciphers CBC and ECB work on units of fixed sizes, such that filling the last block before encryption is required -> padding
### Cipher block chaining - CBC
- each block of plaintext is XORed (exklusives oder, addition without carry)
![1__#$!@%!#__Pasted Graphic 6.png](../_resources/253b87e5ae514b62929d0aa289465c20.png)
- sequential mode of operation -> encryption can't be parallelized
- message must be padded to multiple of the cipher block size
- decryption can be parallelized because each block is XORed with the ciphertext of the previous block
- one-bit change on the ciphertext causes complete corruption of the plaintext and inverts the corresponding bit in the following block of plaintext
